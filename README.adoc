= Tools for Vert.x Context

Mapped Context Tools for Vert.x

== Purpose

Vert.x Tracing SPI combined with EventBus serves as an efficient data store and transport mechanism.
This mechanism enables the propagation of metadata (data about data) and the collection of contextual information across the entire data flow.
Examples include request ownership, role details, or policy metadata that need to be consistently shared across multiple flows.

== Gates

A Gate represents a logical point where the default data transport mechanism is either unsupported or would disrupt the transportation flow.

The EventBus gate is implemented as part of this library and operates seamlessly.
The following gates are currently unsupported, and we plan to add them in future releases:
- Kafka clients
- Elasticsearch clients
- Redis clients
- CircuitBreaker

== Data Items

ContextChainDataItem is an abstract Data Object Model designed for transportation.
To enable serialization and deserialization of these data items, we introduce the ContextChainDataService interface.
